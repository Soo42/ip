# Aries User Guide

Aries is a task manager with a friendly JavaFX chat GUI.
It supports **todos**, **deadlines**, **events**, listing and searching tasks, persistence to disk, and a clean exit via bye. Duplicate tasks are detected by a generated task key so you donâ€™t accidentally add the same thing twice.

## Error handling

- **Invalid command**, **duplicate task enter** and **unexpected** runtime error will be caught by aries.
- Aries will then throw an aries exception.
- Aries will tell what user should follow according to the error message.

## Tips

- your data will be saved instantly once you entered the query.
